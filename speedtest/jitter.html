  <h1>What is Jitter</h1>
  <h3>Jitter is the variation in the time between data packets arriving, caused by network congestion, or route changes.</br>
          The longer data packets take to transmit, the more jitter affects audio quality. The standard jitter measurement is in milliseconds (ms). </br> If receiving jitter is higher than 15-20ms, it can increase latency and result in packet loss, causing audio quality degradation.</h3>
  <h2>Symptoms of jitter include:</h2>
  <h3>
	</br>
	<li>Choppy audio</li>
	  </br>
	  <li>Delayed or dropped calls</li>
</br>
<li>Static, choppy, or garbled audio</li>
</h3>

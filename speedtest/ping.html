  <h1>What is Ping</h1>
  <h3>Ping is a basic Internet program that allows a user to verify that a particular IP address exists and can accept requests.</br>
	  Ping is used diagnostically to ensure that a host computer the user is trying to reach is actually operating.</br> Ping works by sending an Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) Echo Request to a specified interface on the network and waiting for a reply.</br> Ping can be use for troubleshooting to test connectivity and determine response time.</h3>
